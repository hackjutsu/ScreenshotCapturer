# Privacy Policy for Screenshot Capturer

## Introduction

This Privacy Policy explains how Screenshot Capturer ("we", "our", or "the extension") handles user data. We are committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring you have a positive experience when using our extension.

## Data Collection and Usage

### What We Collect

Screenshot Capturer is designed with privacy in mind and collects the absolute minimum amount of data necessary to function:

1. **Screenshots**: The extension captures screenshots of web pages you visit, but only when you explicitly request it by clicking the capture buttons.
2. **Temporary Storage**: Screenshots are temporarily stored in your browser's local storage or as blob URLs in memory to facilitate viewing and downloading.

### How We Use Your Data

- Screenshots are used solely for the purpose of displaying them to you and allowing you to download them.
- All screenshot data remains on your device and is never transmitted to our servers or any third parties.
- Temporary data is automatically cleared when you close the browser tab or when you download the screenshot.

## Data Sharing

We do not share any user data with third parties. All processing happens locally on your device.

## Data Security

Since all data remains on your device and is not transmitted elsewhere, the security of your data depends on your browser's security measures. We recommend keeping your browser updated to the latest version.

## Your Rights

You have complete control over the screenshots taken by the extension:
- You decide when to take a screenshot
- You can choose to download or discard screenshots
- You can uninstall the extension at any time, which will remove any temporary data it may have stored

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on the Chrome Web Store listing. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.
